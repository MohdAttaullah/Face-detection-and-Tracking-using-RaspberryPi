# Face-detection-and-Tracking-using-RaspberryPi
I intend to Implement a real-time Face detection and tracking the head poses position from high definition video using Haar Classifier through Raspberry Pi. SimpleCV and OpenCV libraries are used for face detection and tracking the head poses position. The experimental result computed by using computer vision SimpleCV and OpenCV framework libraries along with above mentioned hardware results were obtained through of 30 fps under 1080p resolutions for higher accuracy and speediness for face detection and tracking the head poses position.
